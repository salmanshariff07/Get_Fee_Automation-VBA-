# Dividend Reissue Fee Automation Tool (VBA)

## From 10 Minutes to Under 10 Seconds ‚Äî Automating a Manual Workflow with VBA

This VBA Macro project automates the calculation and extraction of dividend reissue fees, a process that previously took ~10 minutes manually. With this tool, the same workflow is now completed in under 10 seconds ‚Äî drastically improving efficiency and accuracy.

The tool supports call center agents by speeding up responses to fee-related queries and helping maintain optimal average handling time (AHT).
